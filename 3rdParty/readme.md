# 3rd party

This folder is reserved for 3rd party libraries JCR6 may need (most likely 
compression code).

Please note:
- The core of JCR6 does NOT need any dependencies. Only when you attach drivers that are not part of JCR6 you may need external libraries
- I only included the files I require myself to get the job done. Full sources will not be here as a result
- I do NOT own the copyrights of these libraries. They remain copyrighted and licensed by their respective creators 
- I will not modify any for these libraries. If the need should arise, I will always come up by placing the modified version in a different folder or maybe even a complete new repository

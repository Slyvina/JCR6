# zlib

This is only the zlib library as I use it in my own projects to add zlib support to JCR6.
If you are looking for the actual source code of zlib or anything like that, you came to the wrong place (unfortunately).

Of cource zlib is a project by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, and the zlib license (as placed on top of the zlib.h file) applies.

# zlib

This is only the zlib library as I use it in my own projects to add zlib support to JCR6.

(The source code of zlib is now added to save me some headaches while compiling in Linux. Note though, it's not updated, so you can never tell if this version is up to par. Thank you).

Of cource zlib is a project by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, and the zlib license (as placed on top of the zlib.h file) applies.
